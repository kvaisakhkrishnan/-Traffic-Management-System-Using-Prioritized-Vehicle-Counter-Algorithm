# -Traffic-Management-System-Using-Prioritized-Vehicle-Counter-Algorithm
In todayâ€™s world, where there is a rapid increase in population, every human focuses on simplifying their lives. It has led to a rapid increase in the count of vehicles owned by people day by day. It has also led to a rapid increase in traffic throughout the country. Traffic signals are expected to ensure an effective movement of traffic, allow an opportunity to individuals by walking or vehicles to go through a convergence, and assist with decreasing the quantity of struggles between vehicles entering crossing points from various junctions. Traditional traffic signal system is insufficient to handle such a huge increase in traffic, seen nowadays. We proposed a model which dynamically controls traffic lights using Prioritized Vehicle Counter Algorithm. This will reduce traffic dynamically and give priority to emergency vehicles.
